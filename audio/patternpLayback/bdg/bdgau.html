Select one of the syllables above to hear the sound generated by the Pattern Playback based on the 
formant pattern in the picture, or <A HREF="AU/bdgall.au">listen to the entire continuum.

This page demonstrates a consonant-vowel syllable continuum that starts 
with the sound 
<A HREF="AU/bdg-6.au">"bae"</A>, moves through 
<A HREF="AU/bdg0.au">"dae"</A> and ends up at 
<A HREF="AU/bdg6.au">"gae"</A>.  Each small box 
contains a picture of a "syllable" pattern where the horizontal 
axis represents time, the vertical axis represents frequency, 
and darkness corresponds to energy. 
These syllables were produced using the Pattern Playback by 
hand-painting each of the carefully controlled patterns. Note that 
in this example each syllable consists of two dark bands of energy. 
These energy bands are called <b>formants</b>. The horizontal, steady-state 
portions correspond to the vowel -- in this case, "ae". The frequency transitions 
at the beginning of each syllable determine the consonant quality. In this 
continuum, the lower band of energy (the first formant) is the same  
for each syllable. The only thing that is changing is the second formant 
transition. At the beginning of the continuum (
<A HREF="AU/bdg-6.au">"bae"</A>, step -6) the second 
formant starts much lower in frequency than the steady-state vowel portion. 
By the middle of the continuum (step 0, 
<A HREF="AU/bdg0.au">"dae"</A>), there is no transition -- the second 
formant is flat. At the end of the continuum (step 6, 
<A HREF="AU/bdg6.au">"gae"</A>), 
the second formant transition starts much higher in frequency than the 
steady-state vowel portion.
<p>
This continuum consists of 13 items. The onset of the second formant transition 
is varied in equal frequency steps. The Pattern Playback provided an 
experimental tool that for the first time let researchers systematically 
control the important acoustic information in speech signals. In turn, these 
researchers could then also evaluate the perceptual consequences of these 
careful acoustic manipulations. In the example presented here we can see 
the importance of the second formant transition in determining the 
consonant identity.
